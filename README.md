# Terraform Up & Running — Sample Code Practice

This repository contains example Terraform configurations and exercises inspired by the book **“Terraform: Up & Running”** by Yevgeniy Brikman.  

## Quick start

All the code is in these folders. The code examples are organized 
by chapters. For example, if you're looking at an example of Terraform code in Chapter 2 deploying a single server, you'll find it in the 
[chapter2/one-server](chapter2/one-server) folder.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.

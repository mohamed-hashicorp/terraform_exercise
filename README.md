# Terraform Up & Running — Sample Code Practice

This repository contains example Terraform configurations and exercises inspired by the book **“Terraform: Up & Running”** by Yevgeniy Brikman.  

## Quick start

All the code is in these folders. The code examples are organized 
by chapters. For example, if you're looking at an example of Terraform code in Chapter 2 deploying a single server, you'll find it in the 
- [chapter2](./chapter2/) folder.
- [chapter3](./chapter3/) folder.
- [chapter4](./chapter4/) folder.
- [chapter5](./chapter5/) folder.
- [chapter6](./chapter6/) folder.
- [chapter7](./chapter7/) folder.
- [chapter8](./chapter8/) folder.


For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.
